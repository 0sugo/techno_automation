A well-structured framework includes the following components:

1. Project Structure
2. Test Data Management
3. Page Object Model (POM)
4. Test Case Management
5. Reporting
6. Utilities/ Configuration

1.Project Structure

  selenium_framework/
    1.tests/
      a. test_login.py
      b. test_profile.py
    2.pages/
      a. login_page.py
      b. profile_page.py
    3.data/
      a. test_data.json
      b. test_data.csv
    4.reports/
      a. report.html
      b. screenshots/
    5.utils/
      a. webdriver_factory.py
      b. config_reader.py
      c. logger.py
    6.config/
      a. config.yaml
    7.requirements.txt
    
2.Test Data Management

Test Data Management involves handling data used in tests, such as login credentials, form data, etc. which can manage test data in various formats:

- JSON or CSV Files: Store test data in files for easy editing and management.
- Environment Variables: For sensitive data like passwords.


3.Page Object Model (POM)

POM is a design pattern that makes it easy creating separate classes for each page of the application. Each page class contains methods to interact with elements within that page.

4.Test Case Management

Test cases should be organized in a way that is easy to execute and manage. frameworks like pytest handle test execution and reporting.


1. Reporting and Logging

Reporting involves creating a summary of test results helps to debug and trace test execution.

6. Utilities and Configuration

Utilities include reusable functions or classes, such as those for creating the WebDriver instance, handling configurations, or managing screenshots.
